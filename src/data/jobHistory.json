      "For over two years at Stotles, I've worked as a Full-Stack Engineer on the App team, building the user-facing features that help businesses grow their public sector sales. I specialize in turning complex data into intuitive, high-impact user experiences while modernizing our tech stack for future growth.",
      "During my time at Stotles, I have worked on the development of an innovative AI Q&A tool, enabling users to query complex government procurement data using natural language. This system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Elasticsearch semantic search to provide contextual, AI-driven answers.",
      "I also engineered a complete rewrite of legacy UI table components, creating a highly extensible and reusable system in TypeScript. This initiative eliminated significant tech debt and enables us to rapidly build and manage views for various data types across the application.",
      "I also led the modernization of our core saved search functionality, migrating legacy Ruby on Rails routes to a robust GraphQL API powered by NestJS. This project unified the saved search experience across all data entities and dramatically improved the UI/UX.",
      "I drove significant user engagement and business growth by implementing a critical change to notification email logic that resulted in a large uptick in returning users, and by implementing the company's first self-serve payment system, unlocking a major new revenue channel. This was a key factor in the company's growth and success.",
      "Beyond coding, I also lead a cross-functional Design System working group with designers and engineers to ensure alignment between Figma designs and our codebase, improving maintainability and development velocity.",
      "Key Technologies: TypeScript, NestJS, GraphQL, React, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, AWS, S3, Terraform."

      "My position at Babylon Health as part of the web-platform team involved building tools and procedures for product teams to deliver features quickly to meet user needs.",
      "This required getting involved in a wide variety of work; from creating typescript packages, to designing guidelines, to building development pipelines.",
      "A large part of the work I did on building these packages was ensuring that they were not only functional and met the needs of the various teams within the organisation, but that they were also flexible and maintainable. By building in this manner, as new requirements arose or prior requirements changed, the cost for implementing these changes was low.",
      "In addition to this, I helped to design and write out guidelines for other developers to work with, ensuring a common development flow across teams when working with the platform."

      "I initially joined Made Tech via their academy and in my time at the company progressed to being a Software Engineer. My work at Made Tech as a consultant for public sector clients gave me strong skills as a generalist, helping me to jump into existing codebases and hit the ground running.",
      "The projects I worked on have varied from greenfield projects such as improvements in the collation of contractual data from local councils, to migrating legacy systems to cloud platforms, to working on large scale internal CRM systems. This work was carried out in an agile way, and pairing and mobbing were common aspects of my daily workflow.",
      "Whilst being a consultant required me to pick up multiple tech stacks based upon client needs, I am particularly strong with javascript, typescript, react and express as a tech stack.",
      "The consultancy side of my role also gave me strong skills in dealing with end-users and stakeholders, allowing me to parse large amounts of information and requirements into clear goals. I was then able to communicate this effectively back to clients and deal with concerns and queries in a professional manner."

      "My main role of supporting clients over the phone and email enabled me to cultivate my ability to communicate effectively and with a professional demeanour. In addition, the unscripted support required me to be able to adapt quickly to varying queries and problems, whilst also being able to both understand a query and deliver concise and clearly understandable responses promptly. I also went on-site with clients and provided training and other supplementary services.",
      "In addition to my main support duties at the company, I also expanded my responsibilities to other areas. An example of this was regularly being involved in the QA process for the software and the accurate logging of issues for developers to be able to review.",
      "Within my first year at the company, I also gained a secondary role of looking after documentation and help files for the software suite. The process for this exposed me to both documentation writing and publishing. I completed this through the use of Adobe RoboHelp to create both chm and html files. I managed these additional responsibilities without impacting my core role of support through appropriate time management and prioritisation of tasks."
